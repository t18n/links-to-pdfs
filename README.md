# links-to-pdfs

Convert a list of links to PDF files.

## Getting started
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Edit the `getLinks` function to return the array of all the links you would like to generate. If you want to, you can modify it a bit to scrape a page to grab all links automatically with puppeteer.
- Run `npm run export`.
- Sip a coffee ☕️
- Enjoy!
